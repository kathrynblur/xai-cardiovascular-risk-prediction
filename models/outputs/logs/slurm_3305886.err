/home/hpc/b192aa/b192aa44/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/sklearn/linear_model/_logistic.py:1135: FutureWarning: 'penalty' was deprecated in version 1.8 and will be removed in 1.10. To avoid this warning, leave 'penalty' set to its default value and use 'l1_ratio' or 'C' instead. Use l1_ratio=0 instead of penalty='l2', l1_ratio=1 instead of penalty='l1', and C=np.inf instead of penalty=None.
